## Introduction
Bitwig Performance Twister is an extension for the DAW Bitwig to use the Midi controller "Midi Fighter Twister". I have added additional (optional) functionality to this script so 
that you can see what you are controlling with the Midi controller. You can use a any OSC capable device, that could be an iPad which is running TouchOSC, for instance. And that is 
exactly the setup I am using (and also the only OSC setup which I have tested). 
With the OSC extension you are able to 
* see the functionality of the Midi Fighter Twister, e.g. see on the OSC surface which encoder is controlling which parameter in Bitwig
* see which of the six modes you are currently in
* add additional controls which send and receive OSC messages
* add command buttons to trigger actions in Bitwig
* use the full OSC implementation provided by the Bitwig extension *Driven by Moss*
